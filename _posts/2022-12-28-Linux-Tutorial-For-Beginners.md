# What is Linux?

![](https://linuxtutorialforbeginners.com/assets/Pictures/Linux-Tutorial.webp)

Linux is an open source and free operating system that was first created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. It is based on the Unix operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the 1970s.

Linux is used on many computing devices, including desktop computers, servers, and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is also used in several other devices such as routers, televisions, and even some cars and airplanes.

One of the key features of Linux is its open source nature, which means that the source code of the operating system is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This has led to a large and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the OS and create various software used on it.

Linux is known for its stability, security and flexibility. It is often used in a corporate environment, where the ability to handle large amounts of data and the ability to operate on a variety of devices is valuable. It is also popular with developers due to the availability of tools and programming languages.

Linux is often used as an alternative to proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. It is also used as the basis for other operating systems, such as Google's Android mobile operating system.

Overall, Linux is a powerful and reliable operating system that is widely used in a variety of environments, from personal computing to large enterprise environments. A testament to the flexibility and power of open source software, it continues to be a major player in the world of computing.

Linux distributions, also known as distros, are versions of the Linux operating system packaged with a set of specialized software and tools. It is built on top of the Linux Ubuntu kernel, the core of the operating system, and includes a variety of open source software, including the GNU C library and the X window system.

Linux There are hundreds of different Linux distributions, each with unique features and tools. Some of the most popular distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS.

One of the main advantages of using a Linux distribution is that it allows users to customize the operating system to meet their specific needs. For example, users who are primarily interested in programming can choose a distribution that comes pre-installed with various programming languages ​​and tools. Users who are more interested in desktop productivity can opt for distributions bundled with Office applications and other productivity tools.

Linux distributions are also popular because they are more stable and secure than proprietary operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. They also tend to be less resource-intensive, which means they can run on older or more powerful devices.

In general, Linux distributions offer a wide range of flexibility and customization options, making them a popular choice for users who want to tailor the operating system to their specific needs.

# Basic terms of Linux

**Kernel**: Kernel is the core of the operating system and is responsible for managing our system's hardware and software. It provides an interface between hardware and software applications running in the system.

**Shell**: A shell is a command line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. There are several different shells available for Linux, including the Bourne shell, the C shell, and the Bourne-Again shell (bash).

**Distribution**: A Linux distribution, also known as a distro, is a prepackaged version of the Linux operating system that includes a set of specialized software and tools. Linux There are hundreds of different Linux distributions, each with unique features and tools.

**Package Manager**: A package manager is a tool used to install, update, and uninstall software on Linux systems. Different Linux distributions use different package managers, such as APT (Advanced Package Tool) in Ubuntu and DNF (Dandified Yum) in Fedora.

**Repository**: A repository is a central location where software packages are stored and available for download and installation. Linux distributions usually maintain repositories of software packages specific to that distribution.

**Open Source**: Open source refers to software that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. Linux is an open source operating system, which means that the source code of this operating system can be viewed and modified by anyone. This has led to a large and active community of developers who contribute to the development of the OS and create various software used on it.

**GUI**: A GUI is a type of user interface that allows the user to interact with the operating system using visual elements such as icons, menus, and buttons. Most Linux distributions have a GUI that makes it easy to use for people who are not comfortable using a command line interface.

Terminal: A command line interface (CLI) that allows terminal users to enter commands and interact with the operating system. The terminal can be opened in a GUI environment or accessed through a terminal emulator program.

**Root User**: The root user, also known as superuser, is a special user account with administrative privileges that allows the user to modify the system. It is important to use the root user with caution because it can cause serious consequences if the root user does not modify it properly.

**Permissions**: Permissions are settings for who is allowed to access and modify files and directories on a Linux system. There are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute.

**Directories**: A directory, also known as a folder, is a container for storing files and other directories. The root directory, denoted by the / symbol, is the top-level directory on a Linux system and contains all other directories and files.

**Command Line Arguments**: Command line arguments are additional options or parameters that can be passed to commands when running from the command line interface. They are often used to change the behavior of the command or to specify the input or output for the command.

# Desktop environment

A desktop environment is a graphical user interface (GUI) used to interact with the Linux operating system. It provides a set of tools and features that allow users to perform tasks such as launching applications, managing files and directories, and customizing the appearance of the desktop.

A desktop environment usually includes a window manager responsible for managing the placement and appearance of windows on the desktop, and a horizontal or vertical panel that displays system information and provides access to applications and settings.

## Various desktop environments
There are many different desktop environments for Linux, each with unique features and tools. Some popular desktop environments include GNOME, KDE, and Xfce.

Users can choose which desktop environment to use or set up multiple desktop environments and switch between them. Some Linux distributions use a default desktop environment, while others allow the user to choose which desktop environment to use during installation.

## Why is the desktop environment important?
The desktop environment is an important aspect of the Linux user experience because it provides the interface through which the user interacts with the operating system and performs tasks. Different desktop environments offer different sets of tools and features, so users can choose the one that best suits their needs and preferences.

For example, some desktop environments focus on simplicity and ease of use, while others offer more advanced features and customization options. Some desktop environments are lighter and better suited for use on older or powerful devices, while others are more resource intensive and better suited for use on newer and more powerful systems.

In general, the desktop environment is a key part of the Linux experience, allowing users to tailor the operating system to their specific needs and preferences. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Linux user, there is a desktop environment available for you.

Terminal is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with the Linux operating system and perform various tasks. In this blog post, we'll explore what a terminal is, how to access it, and some basic commands you can use to get started.

## What is a terminal?
A terminal, also known as a command line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface that allows users to enter commands and interact with the operating system. An alternative to using a graphical user interface (GUI), is a more traditional way of interacting with a computer.

Terminal is often used by developers and system administrators because it allows you to do things quickly and efficiently using simple commands. It is also useful for tasks that are not easy to do with a GUI, such as managing system operations or configuring network settings.

## Enter the terminal
You must open a terminal emulator program to access the terminal. In most Linux distributions, you can do this by clicking the terminal icon on the taskbar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T.

Once the terminal emulator is open, you will be presented with a command prompt, which is an icon indicating that the terminal is ready to enter commands. The command prompt is usually the $ symbol, although it can vary depending on the system logo.


## Basic terminal commands
Here are the basic terminal commands you can use to get started:

pwd: Show the current working directory (that is, the directory you are currently logged into).

ls: Lists files and directories in the current working directory.

cd: Change current working directory. For example, cd /home/user/documents will change the current working directory to the documents directory.

mkdir: Create a new directory. For example, mkdir new_directory will create a new directory named new_directory in the current working directory.

Tap: Create a new file. For example, clicking new_file.txt will create a new empty file named new_file.txt in the current working folder.

cp: Copy a file or directory. For example, cp file.txt /home/user/documents will copy file.txt to the documents directory.

mv: Move files or directories. For example, mv file.txt /home/user/documents will move the file file.txt to the documents directory.

rm: Change a file or directory. For example, rm file.txt will delete file.txt. Be careful when using this command as it is not reversible.

man: View the manual page for instructions. For example, man ls will display the manual page for the ls command, which provides information on how to use the ls command and the available options.

These are some of the many commands available in the terminal. As you become more comfortable using the terminal, you can explore additional commands and options to perform more advanced tasks.

Overall, the terminal is a powerful and useful tool that allows users to interact with the Linux operating system and perform various tasks. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, learning how to use the terminal is an essential skill when working with Linux.
