jekyll and WordPress are two popular tools for creating websites, and both have their own strengths and limitations.

Jekyll is a static site generator(ssg), that means generates a fixed set of HTML pages for your website. This makes Jekyll websites fast and lightweight, but it also means that you can't make real-time updates to your content. Instead, you will need to regenerate your site and publish the new HTML pages each time you want to make a change.

One of the main advantages of Jekyll is its simplicity. It is designed to be easy to use and requires no database or server-side programming. This makes it a good choice for users who are new to web development or who want a quick and easy way to create a simple website. the main advantages of using jekyll is **it is free to host**

On the other hand, WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that generates pages dynamically when they are requested by a visitor. This means that you can make real time updates to your content, and your website will always be update.

WordPress is more feature-rich and flexible than Jekyll, with a wide range of themes, plugins, and customization options. It is also easier to use for non-technical users, as it requires no programming knowledge.

Overall, the choice between Jekyll and WordPress will depend on your needs and preferences. If you want a simple, fast website with minimal customization, Jekyll may be a good choice. If you want a more powerful and flexible tool with a wide range of features, WordPress may be a better fit.
