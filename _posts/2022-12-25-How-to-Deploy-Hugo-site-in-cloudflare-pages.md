# Introduction to Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is a static site hosting service that is offered by Cloudflare. It is designed to make it easy for developers to host and manage their static sites, including sites built with the Hugo static site generator.

One of the benefits of using Cloudflare Pages is that it integrates seamlessly with Cloudflare's global content delivery network (CDN), which means that your site will be served quickly and securely to users all around the world. It also has a number of other features, such as automatic SSL certificate management and support for custom domains.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of deploying a Hugo site to Cloudflare Pages. We will cover the following topics:

- Setting up a Cloudflare account and creating a Cloudflare Pages site
- Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site
- Building and deploying your Hugo site to Cloudflare Pages

The first step in deploying your Hugo site to Cloudflare Pages is to set up a Cloudflare account and create a Cloudflare Pages site. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to [https://www.cloudflare.com/](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and click on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the page.

2. Fill out the sign-up form, providing your email address and a password. Then click on the "Create account" button.

3. Check your email for a verification email from Cloudflare, and click on the link provided to verify your email address.

4. Once your email address is verified, log in to your Cloudflare account and click on the "Pages" tab in the top menu.

5. Click on the "Create a new site" button.

6. Enter a name for your site, and choose a subdomain. The subdomain will be used as the URL for your site, so choose something that is descriptive and easy to remember. For example, if you choose "mysite" as the subdomain, your site will be accessible at "mysite.pages.dev".

7. Click on the "Create site" button to create your Cloudflare Pages site.

## Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site

The next step is to set up a Git repository for your Hugo site. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers.

1. If you don't already have a Git repository for your Hugo site, create a new repository on GitHub or another Git hosting service.

2. Initialize a Git repository on your local machine by running the following commands in the root directory of your Hugo site:

``` bash 
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```


3. Add the remote repository as a remote for your local repository by running the following command, replacing "origin" with the URL of your remote repository:

```bash 
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```


## Building and deploying your Hugo site to Cloudflare Pages

Now that you have a Cloudflare Pages site and a Git repository set up, you are ready to build and deploy your Hugo site.

1. Build your Hugo site by running the following command in the root directory of your Hugo site:

```bash 
hugo
```

Cloudflare Pages site and a Git repository set up, you are ready to build and deploy your Hugo site.

1. Build your Hugo site by running the following command in the root directory of your Hugo site:

```bash
git add public
git commit -m "Build site"
```



3. Push the changes to your remote repository by running the following command:

```bash
git push origin master 
```


4. Go back to the Cloudflare Pages dashboard and click on the "Connect a Git provider" button.

5. Choose the Git provider that you are using (e.g. GitHub) and follow the prompts to authorize Cloudflare to access your repository.

6. Once your repository is connected, select it from the dropdown menu and click on the "Connect" button.

7. In the "Branch to deploy" field, enter the name of the branch that you want to deploy (e.g. "master").

8. Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy your site.

It may take a few minutes for your site to be deployed and available at the URL that you specified earlier (e.g. "mysite.pages.dev").
