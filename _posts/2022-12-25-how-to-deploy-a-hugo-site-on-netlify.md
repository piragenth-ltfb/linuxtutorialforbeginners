# Introduction to Netlify

Netlify is a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and host static websites. It is a popular choice for developers due to its simplicity and ease of use.

In this tutorial, we'll go through the process of deploying a Hugo site to Netlify. We will cover the following topics:

- Setting up a Netlify account and creating a new website
- Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site
- Creating and deploying your Hugo site on Netlify

## Setting up a Netlify account and creating a new site

The first step in deploying your Hugo site to Netlify is to set up a Netlify account and create a new site. How to do it:

1. Go to [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/) and click the "Sign Up" button on the top right corner of the page.

2. Fill out the registration form and enter your email address and password. Then click the "Register" button.

3. Check your email for a verification email from Netlify and click the link provided to verify your email address.

4. Once your email address is verified, log in to your Netlify account and click the "New Site from Git" button.

5. Select the Git provider you are using (eg GitHub) and follow the instructions to authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

6. Once your repositories are connected, select the repository that contains your Hugo site and click the "Deploy site" button.

7. Enter the name of your website in the "Site Name" field. This address will be used as your site's URL, so choose something descriptive and easy to remember. For example, if you choose "mysite" as the name, your site will be accessible at "mysite.netlify.app".

8. Click the "Deploy site" button to create your new Netlify site.

## Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site

The next step is to set up a Git repository for your Hugo site. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers.

1. If you don't already have a Git repository for your Hugo site, create a new repository on GitHub or another Git hosting service.

2. Initialize the Git repository on your local machine by running the following commands in the root directory of your Hugo site:

``` bash
git init
git add.
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```


3. Add the remote repository as remote to your local repository by running the following command, replacing "origin" with the URL of your remote repository:


``` bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```


## Creating and deploying your Hugo site to Netlify

Now that you have a Netlify site and a Git repository, you're ready to build and deploy your Hugo site.

1. Create your Hugo site by running the following command in the root directory of your Hugo site:

``` bash
hugo
```


This will generate a static version of your site in the "public" directory.

2. Add the "public" directory to your Git repository by running the following commands:

git add public
git commit -m "Create site"


3. Push the changes to the remote repository by running the following command:

``` bash
git push origin master
```

4. Return to the Netlify control panel and click on the "Deploys" tab.

5. In the "Site Deployment" section, you should see a new deployment in progress. This means that Netlify builds and deploys your website.

6. Once the deployment is complete, your site will be live and accessible at the URL you entered earlier (eg "mysite.netlify.app").

In this tutorial, we went through the process of deploying the Hugo site to Netlify. We have covered the following steps:

- Setting up a Netlify account and creating a new website
