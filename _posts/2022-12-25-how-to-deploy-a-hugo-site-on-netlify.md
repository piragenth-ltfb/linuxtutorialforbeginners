# Introduction to Netlify

Netlify is a cloud-based platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and host static websites. It is a popular choice for developers because of its simplicity and ease of use.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of deploying a Hugo site to Netlify. We will cover the following topics:

- Setting up a Netlify account and creating a new site
- Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site
- Building and deploying your Hugo site to Netlify

## Setting up a Netlify account and creating a new site

The first step in deploying your Hugo site to Netlify is to set up a Netlify account and create a new site. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/) and click on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the page.

2. Fill out the sign-up form, providing your email address and a password. Then click on the "Sign up" button.

3. Check your email for a verification email from Netlify, and click on the link provided to verify your email address.

4. Once your email address is verified, log in to your Netlify account and click on the "New site from Git" button.

5. Choose the Git provider that you are using (e.g. GitHub) and follow the prompts to authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

6. Once your repositories are connected, select the repository that contains your Hugo site and click on the "Deploy site" button.

7. In the "Site name" field, enter a name for your site. This will be used as the URL for your site, so choose something that is descriptive and easy to remember. For example, if you choose "mysite" as the name, your site will be accessible at "mysite.netlify.app".

8. Click on the "Deploy site" button to create your new Netlify site.

## Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site

The next step is to set up a Git repository for your Hugo site. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers.

1. If you don't already have a Git repository for your Hugo site, create a new repository on GitHub or another Git hosting service.

2. Initialize a Git repository on your local machine by running the following commands in the root directory of your Hugo site:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```


3. Add the remote repository as a remote for your local repository by running the following command, replacing "origin" with the URL of your remote repository:


```bash 
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```


## Building and deploying your Hugo site to Netlify

Now that you have a Netlify site and a Git repository set up, you are ready to build and deploy your Hugo site.

1. Build your Hugo site by running the following command in the root directory of your Hugo site:

```bash
hugo
```


This will generate a static version of your site in the "public" directory.

2. Add the "public" directory to your Git repository by running the following commands:

git add public
git commit -m "Build site"


3. Push the changes to your remote repository by running the following command:

```bash
git push origin master
```

4. Go back to the Netlify dashboard and click on the "Deploys" tab.

5. Under the "Site deploys" section, you should see a new deploy in progress. This indicates that Netlify is building and deploying your site.

6. Once the deploy is complete, your site will be live and accessible at the URL that you specified earlier (e.g. "mysite.netlify.app").

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have walked through the process of deploying a Hugo site to Netlify. We covered the following steps:

- Setting up a Netlify account and creating a new site
- Setting up a Git repository for your Hugo site
- Building and deploying your Hugo site to Netlify

With these steps, you should now be able to easily deploy your Hugo site to Netlify and take advantage of the fast and reliable hosting provided by Netlify.
